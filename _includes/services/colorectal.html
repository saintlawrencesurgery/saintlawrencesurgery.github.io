<h1>SCREENING &amp; SURVEILLANCE FOR COLORECTAL CANCER:</h1>

<h2>What is the risk of colorectal cancer?</h2>

<p>
  Colorectal cancer is the SECOND MOST COMMON cancer in the United States.
  The lifetime risk of developing it is about one in twenty.
  The risk is increased if there is a family history of colorectal polyps or cancer, and is higher with a personal history of breast, uterine, or ovarian cancer.
  Risk is also higher in persons with a history of Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn&#39;s Disease.
</p>

<h2>What is screening and surveillance?</h2>

<p>
  Many polyps and cancers of the colon and rectum have no symptoms until they become large.
</p>

<p>
  Screening involves testing to identify whether a person with no symptoms has a disease or condition that may lead to colon or rectal cancer.
  The goal is to identify early to best prevent or cure findings.
</p>

<p>
  Surveillance involves testing those who have had colon polyps or a history of colon cancer, or those who are at increased risk.
  Because these people have an increased risk of developing cancer, they receive more testing.
</p>

<h2>What screening tests should be done?</h2>

<p>
  Colonoscopy is used to diagnose colon and rectal problems and to perform biopsies and remove colon polyps.
  Most colonoscopies are done on an outpatient basis with minimal inconvenience and discomfort.
</p>

<p>
  Stool may be tested for blood, however; only 50% of cancers and 10% of polyps bleed, so this is not a thorough test for screening.
</p>

<h2>What is a colonoscopy?</h2>

<p>
  A colonoscopy is a safe, effective method of examining the full lining of the colon and rectum.
  By using a long, flexible, tubular instrument, it is able to diagnose colon and rectal problems and also able to perform biopsies and remove colon polyps.
  Patients are monitored under the anesthesia team, and the procedure is completed on an outpatient basis.
</p>

<h2>Who should have a colonoscopy?</h2>

<p>
  A colonoscopy is routinely recommended to adults 50 years of age or older as a part of a colorectal cancer screening program.
  Patients who have a family history of colon cancer may have earlier monitoring.
  This is done in intervals of 3-10 years depending on what is observed during the colonoscopy.
</p>

<p>
  Patients with personal history of colon cancer or polyps will also vary in the frequency of screening depending on the type of polyp and their personal history.
  It is typically modified patient to patient.
</p>

<p>
  Also, physicians also may recommend a colonoscopy with bowel changes or bleeding. A colonoscopy may:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check unexplained abdominal symptoms</li>
  <li>Check inflammatory bowel disease</li>
  <li>Verify findings of polyps or tumors located with a barium enema exam</li>
  <li>Examine patients who test positive for blood in stool</li>
  <li>Find a source of iron deficiency anemia</li>
  <li>Monitor patients with a personal or family history of colon polyps or cancer</li>
</ul>

<h2>How is a colonoscopy performed?</h2>

<p>
  The bowel is first cleared of all residue before the procedure, to allow for visualization of the colon.
  This is done with a bowel preparation.
</p>

<p>
  The patient is then under anesthesia.
</p>

<p>
  The colonoscope is inserted into the rectum and advanced to the portion of the colon where the small intestine joins the colon.
  During this, if polyps are seen, they are immediately removed, tissue also may be sampled and sent for pathology.
</p>

<p>
  The procedure takes less than one hour and patients require someone to drive them from the hospital.
  They are then able to resume regular diet and activities that same day.
</p>

<h2>What are the risks?</h2>

<p>
  This is a very safe procedure with complication occurring in less than 1% of patients. Risks include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bleeding</li>
  <li>Tearing of the intestine</li>
  <li>Risks of anesthesia</li>
  <li>Failure to detect a polyp</li>
</ul>
